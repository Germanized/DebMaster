## A Note for Eevee

Hi [@whoeevee](https://github.com/whoeevee),

I developed DebMaster with the goal of making tools like **EeveeSpotifyReborn** more accessible to a wider audience. Many users who are not deeply familiar with the command line or the intricacies of `.ipa` patching find it challenging to get started.

DebMaster provides a simple, GUI-based solution that allows anyone to download your latest releases and patch them into the Spotify IPA in just a few clicks. I believe that featuring this tool on your repository would be incredibly beneficial for your users, especially those who are less tech-savvy.

On a more personal note, I want to sincerely thank you for creating the Telegram bot [@eeveedecrypterbot](https://t.me/eeveedecrypterbot). It's an amazing and easy-to-use tool that saves users from having to navigate shady websites just to find decrypted IPAs, which are often filled with ads and aren't 100% safe. Your bot saved me from having to develop a separate tool for decryption, though I might explore creating my own in the future to avoid API limits.

Thank you for your amazing work. I hope DebMaster can help bring it to even more users.
